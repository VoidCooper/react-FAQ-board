# Why does this repository exist?

I created this app to learn React and to show what I can do with react.

# Is there any other things used than React?

Yes! When I started creating this application, I decided to use Redux for state handling, React-Router to make it as a single page application, Transition Groups to add some animations and TypeScript.

# Noticed an issue with the code?

Create a new issue and I will see to it, and propably do something about it.
